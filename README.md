# Einstein vs Newton

This visualization contrasts Einstein's prediction of a shifting perihelion in planetary orbits with Newton's static perihelion model, underscored by a graph comparing their potential energy predictions, highlighting Einstein's theory's ability to indicate relativistic effects such as the event horizon.

This showcases a comparative analysis of the perihelion shift as predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity and Newtonian Mechanics. On the left, the orbit simulation adheres to Einstein's framework, illustrating a noticeable perihelion shift—an effect of spacetime curvature around massive bodies. Contrastingly, the right side presents the Newtonian perspective, where the orbit's perihelion remains constant, disregarding the relativistic effects.

It's important to acknowledge that Newtonian mechanics does predict perihelion shifts due to gravitational interactions with other celestial bodies. However, it falls short of accounting for the entirety of observations, particularly those in close proximity to massive objects where relativistic effects become significant.

Below the orbital simulations, a real-time potential energy graph for the orbiting body under both theories is displayed. The graph underlines the divergences in potential energy predictions between the two theories. Notably, Einstein's plot suggests the presence of a black hole event horizon, indicated by the potential energy curve intersecting the y=0 axis—a feature absent from Newtonian predictions and not depicted in this specific plot.

This comparative visualization serves as a stark illustration of the advancements in our understanding of gravitational phenomena, highlighting the nuanced and comprehensive nature of Einstein's theory over the classical Newtonian interpretation.
